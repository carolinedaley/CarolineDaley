###Code.org Projects

[RobotFace](https://CarolineDaley.github.io/RobotFace/)
>In this project I used shapes, variables, and randomness to express my creativity and created a Random Robot Face. 

[CaptionedScene](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/SrEECsy168MHkuKZjo2IrUDnHRigl40-JI9niJ2Os5g)
>In this project, my partner and I used our imaginations to create a unique winter/Christmas scene. We used random variables to change the color of the backgroung everytime, rectangles, ellipses, and arcs. 

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/Vo0KUX6q_fi51u6RBtnpXRGNUtospT9MC54LAFhna8U/)
> In this interactive card my partner and I made a Happy Birthday card. The card shows a boy who recieves presents and his mood changes from sad to happy. The presents also change appearance to the actual object, using keyboard input. Also, we used balloons that travel from both sides of the screen to the other sides. Lastly, we also have a balloon that can be moved across the screen using the arrow keys. 

[Side Scroller](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/tVX6-0qUsbbSR49L7kSqQdGy75UyIxLbfMXXPpQDsk4)
> In this project, my partner and I used different sprites and conditions to make a game. In the game, the girl had to move to avoid the bug which would hurt her health. She also had to move to collect pumpkins and up her score. 

[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/aZghPkpIay0TdICeS4BrRlH0bkFplv83uDNrcx3u-yY)
> In this project, we used several conditions, sprites and if statements to allow multiple different types of sprites to move. The hippo, which was the player, had to move using arrows on the keyboard. The germs randomly generted at sides of the screen and traveled along the sreen to the other side. When they reache dthe other side, they would loop back and start at a random location. Also, these germs displaced the hippo whne the hippo touched them. Lastly, the blueberry was the aim for the hippo. When the hippo touched the blueberry, the blueberry regenerated to a new random location. 

[Platform Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/AymshRKc2_AstfhG-XqVvRUBpAY8fvb0nAtpoYvdaTo)
> In this project, I used multiple different variables and interactions. Th eplatforms displace he character, and the character gathered points by touching the candy. If the character got outside of the screen, the game was over. For my sprites, I used an alien and two pieces of candy. The background changes color as points get to a certain number. 

[Project - Design a Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/m8Lbat-HYXCklt6wrD3MbVsFhI6_m6k5z3ugpqzJDA8)
> In this project, I used changing backgrounds, which was a new idea. I continued to use several different sprites. These sprites included a lion, an alien, a cookie, and a germ. All of the sprites had different interactions with one another. When the lion touched the alien, the alien was displaced. When the cookie tocuhed the alien, the alien gained a point. When the germ touched the alien, the alien lost a point. When a certain number of points were gained (5), the background changed. The background also changed when the lion was able to move the alien off of the screen. I used multiple functions and if/then statements to comeplete this project.

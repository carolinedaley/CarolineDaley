### CODE.ORG PROJECTS

[RobotFace](https://CarolineDaley.github.io/RobotFace/)
>In this project I used shapes, variables, and randomness to express my creativity and created a Random Robot Face. 

[CaptionedScene](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/SrEECsy168MHkuKZjo2IrUDnHRigl40-JI9niJ2Os5g)
>In this project, my partner and I used our imaginations to create a unique winter/Christmas scene. We used random variables to change the color of the backgroung everytime, rectangles, ellipses, and arcs. 

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/Vo0KUX6q_fi51u6RBtnpXRGNUtospT9MC54LAFhna8U/)
> In this interactive card my partner and I made a Happy Birthday card. The card shows a boy who recieves presents and his mood changes from sad to happy. The presents also change appearance to the actual object, using keyboard input. Also, we used balloons that travel from both sides of the screen to the other sides. Lastly, we also have a balloon that can be moved across the screen using the arrow keys. 

[Side Scroller](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/tVX6-0qUsbbSR49L7kSqQdGy75UyIxLbfMXXPpQDsk4)
> In this project, my partner and I used different sprites and conditions to make a game. In the game, the girl had to move to avoid the bug which would hurt her health. She also had to move to collect pumpkins and up her score. 

[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/aZghPkpIay0TdICeS4BrRlH0bkFplv83uDNrcx3u-yY)
> In this project, we used several conditions, sprites and if statements to allow multiple different types of sprites to move. The hippo, which was the player, had to move using arrows on the keyboard. The germs randomly generted at sides of the screen and traveled along the sreen to the other side. When they reache dthe other side, they would loop back and start at a random location. Also, these germs displaced the hippo whne the hippo touched them. Lastly, the blueberry was the aim for the hippo. When the hippo touched the blueberry, the blueberry regenerated to a new random location. 

[Platform Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/AymshRKc2_AstfhG-XqVvRUBpAY8fvb0nAtpoYvdaTo)
> In this project, I used multiple different variables and interactions. Th eplatforms displace he character, and the character gathered points by touching the candy. If the character got outside of the screen, the game was over. For my sprites, I used an alien and two pieces of candy. The background changes color as points get to a certain number. 

[Project - Design a Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/m8Lbat-HYXCklt6wrD3MbVsFhI6_m6k5z3ugpqzJDA8)
> In this project, I used changing backgrounds, which was a new idea. I continued to use several different sprites. These sprites included a lion, an alien, a cookie, and a germ. All of the sprites had different interactions with one another. When the lion touched the alien, the alien was displaced. When the cookie tocuhed the alien, the alien gained a point. When the germ touched the alien, the alien lost a point. When a certain number of points were gained (5), the background changed. The background also changed when the lion was able to move the alien off of the screen. I used multiple functions and if/then statements to comeplete this project.


### MIT APP INVENTOR PROJECTS

[Hello It's Me](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=ea04e304-54e6-4bdc-be48-71f30607aa63)
> In this project I imported pictures of animal and coded it so when you click on an animal, that animal makes a sound.

[My Piano](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=2c1b0a87-ff99-458f-86e1-19a4e33bf423)
> In this project, I associated sounds with different keys on the colored piano to allow the corresponding sound to play.

[Music Maker]( https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=93b0af2c-3bc7-483d-a7f1-4a8cb5efae7b)
> In this project I imported sounds to correspond with the picture that is clicked on.

[Find the Gold](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=61f8de15-6f64-4007-8aca-2218c08a517a)
> In this project, we coded it os when the tablet is tilted a ball moves and the gold can be found. This incorporates actions from a person using the game, as well as coding. 


### CMU PYTHON PROJECTS

[CMU Creative Task #1](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/deepSkyBlueSnail5068)
> In this project, I created a birthdya cake. I used multiple different shapes and colors. Some of the shapes included circles, lines, stars, polygons and ovals. Additionally, I used different cololors to add more detail to the drawing. I included a graidnet to give the background more dimension as well. I organized the code by seperating each different part of the picture, allowing for the drawing to be organized and neat.

[CMU Creative Task #2](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/antiqueWhiteEagle3373)
> For this creative task, we used multiple different shapes and colors to create a boat and ocean scene. We used definitions and onMousePress and onMouseRelease to show two different scenes. When the mouse was pressed, the scene turned into night, but otherwise, the scene was during the daytime. We used opacity to create a sun spreading light across the ocean that created reflections. 

[CMU Creative Task #3](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/blanchedAlmondDog9620)
> For this project, we used gradients, colors, and multiple shapes to be able to create a flower and sky scene. We used an opacity to make the sun fade away everytime the mouse is clicked. Also, when the mouse is clicked, a new flower would appear from the vase and the point where the mouse clicked. Also, on mouse click, the color of the background changed.

[CMU Creative Task #4](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/papayaWhipBird8638).
> For this project, we utilized the keyboard, opacity, lines, and polygons. We created our lion shape using multiple points in a polygon. Then, we separated the screen into a top and bottom half that both had different colors. When keys were pressed (WASD) or the mouse was clicked, the lions fill would change color based on where it was located. There would be a gradient if the lion was placed in the middle.
